    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "1. string data type - str\n",
    "   In python string is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes.\n",
    "2. numeric data type - int, float, complex\n",
    "   In Python numeric data type is used to hold numeric values.\n",
    "3. boolean data type - bool\n",

    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that are compiled together.\n",
    "Expressions are used to  produce some value or result after being interpreted by the Python interpreter.\n",

    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "In python variable name can not start with digit. variable name begin with a letter (a-z or A-Z) or an underscore (_). \n",
    "eggs start with letter, so it is a valid variable name and 100 starts with digit, so its invalid.\n",

    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "int(): This function is used to convert a value to an integer type.\n",
    "float(): This function is used to convert a value to a floating-point number type.\n",

    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression cause error because we can only concatenate strings and string is the values inside the quotes.\n",
    "Here in this expression 99 is an integer because it is not inside quotes.\n",
    "that is why this expression causing error."
