    "    Functions that are readily available within the python library are known as built-in functions. \n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "To pass agrgument to a fuction in python,we use positional arguments and keyword arguments-\n",
    "1.Positional arguments:-Positional arguments are passed to a function based on their position or order. \n",
    "    The function's parameters are defined in a specific order, and when calling the function, the arguments are matched with the parameters based on their position.\n",
    "    The number of arguments passed must match the number of parameters in the function definition.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.Keyword arguments:-Keyword arguments are passed to a function using the name of the parameter along with the corresponding value. \n",
    "    Instead of relying on the order, keyword arguments explicitly specify which parameter each argument is intended for.\n",
    "    This allows you to pass arguments in any order, making the function call more readable and flexible."

    "Ans:- scope-variables can only reach the area in which they are defined, which is called scope. \n",
    "1.Local Scope:\n",
    "Local scope refers to variables that are defined within a specific block or function. These variables are only accessible within the block or function where they are defined. \n",

    "Outside the function, attempting to access the variable x will result in a NameError.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Global Scope:\n",
    "Global scope refers to variables that are defined outside of any function or block. \n",
    "These variables are accessible throughout the program, including within functions or blocks. \n",
    "They are known as \"global variables\" and can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program.\n",

    "print(x)      # Output: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the variable x is defined outside the function my_function(). \n",
